# Navigation
General navigation goes through local-conditional-card. Which basically works by showing or hiding a card.

# The top menu bar
To display more icons, I use a swipe-card.

The search bar opens a ChatGPT popup for me

The search bar spans the full width of the menu bar.
When a media is read, this bar is reduced and shows the current reading.
The background color of the menu changes according to the current reading

Several cards have animations and colors that change depending on the state. Some also have a notification badge
